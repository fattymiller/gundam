## Gundam

This bot has as its primary mission ~~win the Gundam Fight~~ identify Jira Issue identifiers in a GitHub Pull Request and adds links to any Jira issues found to the comments on that Pull Request, and in turn simplifying the navigation between Pull Request and relevant Jira Issue.

Currently, Jira integration works one-way with Github. Where Jira is notified of new Pull Requests that mention the issue in its title and/or description and are linked back to GitHub, but no links are made in the reverse direction.
