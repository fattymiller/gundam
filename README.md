## Gundam

This bot has as its primary mission ~~win the Gundam Fight~~ identify Jira Issue identifiers in a github pull request and comment on that pull request the links for the relevant Jira Issues, thus simplifying navigation between Pull Request and its equivalent Jira Issue.

Jira integration with Github works one way, with Jira being notified of Pull Requests that mention a Jira Issue in its title, or description, however Github does not link the Pull Request to the Jira issue.
